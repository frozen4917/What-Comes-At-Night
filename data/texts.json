    "loc_desc_campsite_first": "A group of monsters is hot on your tail. The night is dangerous. You've managed to outrun the horde and get some time to get yourself under control. You find yourself in a campsite amidst a rough clearing through the woods as the sun begins to set. Several tents are pitched around a warm campfire. A wooden cabin stands at the far west. A small wooden pier extends over the dark water ahead.",
    "loc_desc_campsite_current": [
        "You remain at the campsite. The campfires burn bright, enough to provide you with some warmth.",
        "The campsite remains your position. Overhead, the trees sway gently, their branches creating shifting patterns of light and shadow across the tents and cabin",
        "You remain at the campsite, staying close to the fire's warmth. The flames pop and hiss occasionally, sending sparks spiraling upward into the night sky.",
        "You stay put at the campsite, the familiar surroundings offering what comfort they can."

    "loc_desc_campsite_return": [
        "You return to the campsite, relieved to see the fire still burning strong. The generator's hum continues to be nothing but just background noise for you.",
        "You make your way back to the centre of the campsite. The glow of the fire and cabin lights guides you in, a beacon of relative safety in the darkness.",
        "You return to the clearing, the familiar layout of the campsite greeting you. The piers stretch out into darkness and the fire burns straight ahead."
    ],

    "loc_desc_cabin_first": "You step into the wooden cabin and close the door behind you, muffling the sounds of the night outside. The interior is cozy and well-maintained. A worn sofa faces a cold fireplace, and someone's jacket hangs on a peg by the door. Maps and a schedule are pinned to a corkboard near the window. The cabin smells of pine wood, lamp oil, and the faint mustiness of a place that's lived-in but currently empty. Through the windows, you can see the campfire outside, but in here, the generator's hum is more muted. It feels safer somehow, with walls between you and whatever's out there.",
    "loc_desc_cabin_current": [
        "You remain inside the cabin, the solid walls around you providing a sense of security.",
        "You stay inside the cabin, listening to the muffled sounds of the night beyond the walls. The wooden floor creaks slightly as you shift your weight.",
        "You're still inside, grateful for the barrier between you and the darkness."

    "loc_desc_cabin_return": [
        "You return to the cabin and step back inside, pulling the door shut behind you. The lamplight welcomes you back, unchanged since you left.",
        "You return to the cabin's shelter, closing the door firmly behind you. Through the windows, you can see the campfire still burning outside, but in here feels safer.",
        "You make your way back to the cabin and enter. Everything is exactly as you left it."

    "loc_desc_graveyard_first": "You arrive at the graveyard, and a chill runs down your spine that has nothing to do with the temperature. You remember glimpsing this place earlier when you were fleeing toward the campsite. Now here you are, standing among the dead. The graveyard sprawls across uneven ground, dotted with tombstones of varying ages. A gravekeeper's hut  stands near the entrance. A small shed sits further back.",
    "loc_desc_graveyard_current": [
        "You remain in the graveyard, acutely aware of how exposed you are here.",
        "You're still among the graves. The wind picks up slightly, making the loose shutter on the gravekeeper's hut bang.",
        "You stay in the graveyard, though every instinct screams at you to leave.",
        "You stay among the graves, counting the tombstones you can see, anything to keep your mind occupied."

    "loc_desc_graveyard_return": [
        "You make your way back to the graveyard along the path. The iron gates come into view, and beyond them, the familiar arrangement of graves and monuments.",

        "You visit the graveyard once again. You hope that you can survive an ambush here."

    "dusk_flavor_10": "The sun bleeds orange across the horizon, its dying light casting long shadows that stretch like grasping fingers across the ground. The air still holds the day's warmth, but there's a whisper of something colder creeping in.",
    "dusk_flavor_9": "Golden light filters through the trees, turning everything amber. The first evening birds begin their calls, oblivious to what the darkness might bring.",
    "dusk_flavor_8": "The sun sinks lower, painting the clouds in shades of crimson and purple.",
    "dusk_flavor_7": "The sky burns with the last defiant rays of daylight. A gentle breeze picks up, carrying the scent of cooling earth and distant pine.",
    "dusk_flavor_6": "Twilight settles over the landscape like a veil. The boundary between light and shadow blurs as the sun touches the horizon, preparing for its final descent.",
    "dusk_flavor_5": "The sun is half-swallowed by the earth now. Its light has turned from gold to deep orange. The ambient temperature begins to drop.",
    "dusk_flavor_4": "Only a sliver of sun remains visible, painting the sky in darkening purples. The first stars appear overhead, faint and tentative against the fading blue.",
    "dusk_flavor_3": "The last curve of the sun disappears, leaving only its afterglow.",
    "dusk_flavor_2": "The sky transitions from purple to deep indigo. Shadows have merged into larger patches of darkness, and the stars grow brighter with each passing second.",
    "dusk_flavor_1": "Dusk's final moments fade as the sky deepens to navy. The first hint of true darkness creeps across the land, and the air grows noticeably cooler against your skin.",

    "evening_flavor_8": "Evening arrives with a blanket of darker blue-grey across the heavens. The stars are now clearly visible, scattered like diamonds across velvet, and the moon begins its ascent. The comfortable warmth of day is gone, replaced by a chill that makes you pull your clothing tighter.",
    "evening_flavor_7": "The sky deepens to a rich cobalt, with the brightest stars forming their familiar constellations.",
    "evening_flavor_6": "Darkness settles more. Night sounds begin: crickets chirping and the distant hoot of an owl setting out to hunt.",
    "evening_flavor_5": " The moon climbs higher, casting everything in shades of silver and shadow. Trees become dark silhouettes against the star-filled sky, their branches like skeletal hands reaching upward.",
    "evening_flavor_4": "Evening's grip tightens as the last traces of twilight vanish from the western horizon. The night is fully awake now, and every sound seems amplified in the quiet darkness.",
    "evening_flavor_3": "The moon's light creates a patchwork of illumination and shadow across the ground. A cold breeze rustles through the vegetation, carrying sounds that are harder to identify in the dark.",
    "evening_flavor_2": "Moonlight now gleams off surfaces: water, stone, anything smooth enough to reflect it back.",
    "evenin_flavor_1": "Evening reaches its deepest point before transitioning to true night. The stars wheel slowly overhead, and the shadows seem to shift and move at the edges of your vision.",

    "nightfall_flavor_8": "True nightfall descends like a curtain, and the darkness takes on weight and substance. The moon hangs bright but somehow distant, its light feeling colder now, less comforting than before. The night sounds have changed: some creatures have gone silent, while others you can't identify have started calling.",
    "nightfall_flavor_7": "The cold intensifies as the temperature plummets. Shadows pool thick and heavy beneath trees and overhangs, places where moonlight cannot reach.",
    "nightfall_flavor_6": "A deep chill has settled over everything. Your breath comes out in visible clouds now.",
    "nightfall_flavor_5": "The night deepens further still. The moon's journey across the sky continues, and its angle creates unfamiliar shadows that make familiar landscapes seem strange and foreign.",
    "nightfall_flavor_4": "The remaining warmth left over from the day is completely gone, replaced by the deep cold of true night.",
    "nightfall_flavor_3": "Silence falls more heavily now, broken only by the occasional crack of a twig or the distant cry of a night bird. The darkness between shadows seems somehow darker.",
    "nightfall_flavor_2": "he moon reaches its highest point, bathing everything in pale, colorless light. But there are more shadows now.",
    "nightfall_flavor_1": "The world feels suspended, caught between the evening that was and the deeper darkness yet to come.",

    "deep_night_flavor_9": "Deep night arrives with an almost physical presence, as if the darkness itself has grown thicker, more tangible. The moon continues its arc but seems to give less light than before, its beams struggling to penetrate the gloom. Strange sounds echo from the darkness. This is the hour when natural creatures hide, and other forces emerge.",
    "deep_night_flavor_8": "Shadows seem to pulse and breathe at the periphery of vision, never quite still when you're not looking directly at them.",
    "deep_night_flavor_7": "An unnatural mist begins to rise from the ground, curling around rocks and tree roots like grasping fingers.",
    "deep_night_flavor_6": "The moonlight takes on an eerie quality, turning everything it touches into shades of grey and white.",
    "deep_night_flavor_5": "The Deep Night continues as the time passes. Sounds that shouldn't exist drift through the air: whispers without words, footsteps without feet.",
    "deep_night_flavor_4": "The night sky deepens into absolute black, like a void, dotted with stars.",
    "deep_night_flavor_3": "The cold mist continues to form. Something feels fundamentally wrong about this hour.",
    "deep_night_flavor_2": "The moon's light wavers, as if something massive is passing between it and the earth.",
    "deep_night_flavor_1": "The boundary between what's real and what isn't seems thinner here, at this depth of night. Shapes in the mist could be trees, or they could be something else entirely.",

    "witching_hour_flavor_10": "The Witching Hour crashes down like a wave of pure darkness. The moon dims as if shrouded by invisible clouds, and the stars themselves seem to flicker uncertainly. The temperature plummets. This is the time when the veil is thinnest, when the dead walk and the things that should not be find their way into the world.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_9": "The darkness writhes and pulses with unseen presence. Shapes seem move through the mist with purpose now.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_8": "The night sky intensifies. The shadows have gained depth, becoming doorways to somewhere else.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_7": "The moon bleeds a sickly color, somewhere between silver and red.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_6": " Time feels distorted, stretching and compressing. Seconds last hours, minutes pass in heartbeats.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_5": "The Witching Hour reaches its apex. The boundary between worlds is paper-thin now, and things press against it from the other side.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_4": "Dead leaves swirl in spirals without wind to move them. Every sound seems swallowed by the oppressive stillness. The ground itself seems to hold its breath.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_3": "The Witching Hour continues. The stars trace paths slowly, offering no sign of hope or dawn to come.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_2": "The stars begin their slow wheel toward morning positions, though dawn is still impossibly far away.",
    "witching_hour_flavor_1": "The witching hour's grip begins to weaken... barely. The absolute stillness starts to break as the faintest breath of wind stirs. The moon's color begins its slow fade back toward normal silver.",

    "pre_dawn_flavor_5": "The first hint of change arrives. The absolute black of the sky begins to lighten to merely dark grey in the far east. The unnaturality that filled the witching hour seem to stop. The temperature remains brutally cold, but no longer drops. The moon, pale and exhausted, begins its descent toward the western horizon. You've survived the worst. You just have to hold on a little longer.",
    "pre_dawn_flavor_4": "The eastern horizon shows a line of slightly lighter grey, barely distinguishable from the darkness above it.",
    "pre_dawn_flavor_3": "The stars begin to fade, the brightest ones clinging to visibility as the sky slowly lightens.",
    "pre_dawn_flavor_2": "The shadows lose their depth and menace, becoming ordinary darkness once more. Birds begin their first tentative chirps.",
    "pre_dawn_flavor_1": "The pre-dawn light strengthens, turning the world into a landscape of grey, silver, and yellow. The moon sets as its night's work done, and the cold finally begins to lose its cruel edge.",

    "phase_intro_dawn": "Dawn breaks like a golden sword cutting through the last remnants of darkness. The sun crests the horizon in a blaze of orange and pink and gold. The light is warm and real. The frost begins to melt immediately. Birds erupt into full chorus, celebrating the return of day with joyous abandon. The shadows retreat to their proper places. The cold breaks as warmth floods across the land, and you can finally breathe freely, deeply, without fear."
